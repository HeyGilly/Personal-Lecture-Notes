An algorithm:
    - a set of instructions for accomplishing a task.
    - Every piece of code could be called an algorithm

Binary Search:
    - An algorithm that takes in a sorted list of elements and returns the element your looking for position. If not in list the binary search returns null.
    - An Example of Binary Search is if you are looking for a word that starts with an "o", instead of starting with "A" till you find the word, you open the dictionary nea the middle.
    - The binary_search function takes a sorted array and an item. If the item is in the array, the function returns its position.
    Formula:
        log2n steps

Simple Search:
    - Going one by one and checking to see if your element is the one you picked.
    Formula:
        'n' steps
